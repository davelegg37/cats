		<div>NEXT</div>
		<div>Back</div>
		<div>Once long ago the world was dominated by cats:  big cats, ferocious cats, cats that hunted, but things change.</div>
		<div>Foxes also lived in this world of cats and unfortunately for them foxes were the big cats’ favorite appetizer.  Foxes spent their days frantically trying to avoid the cats’ dinner table.  Foxes weren't big and strong like cats, but they were smart.</div>
		<div>Now cats weren't born hunters.  Mother cats would spend hours training kittens in the skills of the hunt. They trained all their kittens irregardless of their natural abilities. They trained both weak and strong kittens, kittens quick and slow, kittens that were smart and kittens not so smart, even those kittens with low attention spans; all  were trained to be hunters.  As a result of this universal education all cats grew up to be hunters, but some were better hunters then others and most were average.</div>
		<div>One day as a fox watched a mother cat finally lose her patience with a particularly difficult student an idea occurred. “What foxes lack in strength they make up for in brains.”  The foxes time had come.</div>
		<div>Foxes had found that cats with full bellies were not very dangerous and could even be engaged in conversation; if they were not a sleep. After the mother cats had eaten and before they nodded off, the fox approached.</div>
		<div>"I have been watching you train your kittens," said the fox to the drowsy cats. "You waste a lot of time trying to train those kittens that are slow learners. Why don't you just train the talented kittens?  It would be a lot easier and quicker. Then you would have more time to sleep." Now if there is one thing cats love better than eating and hunting it's sleeping, so the mother cats took the fox's advice.</div>
		<div>The mother cats began to train only those cats that showed a definite aptitude for hunting.  From each new litter they would select only the top cats to train as hunters.  The rest of the kittens were given a few cursory lessons to determine if they had talent and then left to fend for themselves.  Everyone was happy.  Average kittens were left to play all day, top cats with the extra attention devoted to their training became superb hunters and the mother cats had much more time to sleep. Everyone was happy at first, but things change.</div>
		<div>The average cats skills declined and they were no longer effective hunters.  The most they could catch was an occasional mouse, not much nourishment for the ferocious beast they had once been. As their prey diminished in size so did they until they became the house cats we know today; pale imitations of the ferocious hunters they once were.</div>
		<div>There are still a few of those wild terrible hunters around but their numbers are shrinking and they are no longer much of a threat to the fox population, which now has an occasional house cat for diner.
